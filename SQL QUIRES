where emp_rating between 2 and 4;

5.	Write a query to concatenate the FIRST_NAME and the LAST_NAME of employees in the Finance department from the employee table and then give the resultant column alias as NAME.

select concat(first_name,' ',last_name) as NAME ,DEPT from emp_record_table
where dept='finance';

6.	Write a query to list only those employees who have someone reporting to them. Also, show the number of reporters (including the President).

WHERE DEPT='HEALTHCARE'
UNION
SELECT * FROM emp_record_table
WHERE DEPT='FINANCE';

8.	Write a query to list down employee details such as EMP_ID, FIRST_NAME, LAST_NAME, ROLE, DEPARTMENT, and EMP_RATING grouped by dept. Also include the respective employee rating along with the max emp rating for the department.
SELECT E.EMP_ID,E.first_name,E.last_name,E.ROLE,E.dept,E.emp_rating,M.MAX_EMP_RATING
from emp_record_table E 
JOIN
(SELECT DEPT,MAX(emp_rating) as max_emp_rating
from emp_record_table 
GROUP BY DEPT ) M 
ON E.DEPT=M.DEPT ORDER BY DEPT, EMP_RATING;

9.	Write a query to calculate the minimum and the maximum salary of the employees in each role. Take data from the employee record table.

SELECT EMP_ID,first_name,last_name,ROLE,SALARY,
MAX(SALARY) OVER(PARTITION BY ROLE ) AS MAXIMUM_SALARY,
MIN(SALARY) OVER(PARTITION BY ROLE ) AS MINIMUM_SALARY
FROM emp_record_table;

10.	Write a query to assign ranks to each employee based on their experience. Take data from the employee record table.

SELECT EMP_ID,first_name,last_name,ROLE,EXP,COUNTRY,
RANK() OVER(ORDER BY EXP DESC) AS RANKS
FROM emp_record_table;

11.	Write a query to create a view that displays employees in various countries whose salary is more than six thousand. Take data from the employee record table.

CREATE VIEW SALARY_MORE AS(
SELECT * FROM emp_record_table
WHERE SALARY>6000);
SELECT * FROM SALARY_MORE;

12.	Write a nested query to find employees with experience of more than ten years. Take data from the employee record table.

SELECT emp_id, first_name, last_name, role, dept, EXP
FROM emp_record_table
WHERE EXP > (
    SELECT 10
);

13.	Write a query to create a stored procedure to retrieve the details of the employees whose experience is more than three years. Take data from the employee record table.

DELIMITER $$
CREATE PROCEDURE EMPLOYEE_EXPERIENCE()
BEGIN
SELECT * FROM emp_record_table WHERE EXP>3;
END $$
DELIMITER ;
CALL EMPLOYEE_EXPERIENCE();

14.	Write a query using stored functions in the project table to check whether the job profile assigned to each employee in the data science team matches the organization’s set standard.

The standard being:
For an employee with experience less than or equal to 2 years assign 'JUNIOR DATA SCIENTIST',
For an employee with the experience of 2 to 5 years assign 'ASSOCIATE DATA SCIENTIST',
For an employee with the experience of 5 to 10 years assign 'SENIOR DATA SCIENTIST',
For an employee with the experience of 10 to 12 years assign 'LEAD DATA SCIENTIST',
For an employee with the experience of 12 to 16 years assign 'MANAGER'.


DROP FUNCTION IF EXISTS EXP_JOB_PROFILE;
DELIMITER $$
CREATE FUNCTION EXP_JOB_PROFILE(EXP VARCHAR(50))
RETURNS VARCHAR(50)
DETERMINISTIC
BEGIN
	DECLARE profile_1 VARCHAR(50);
	CASE
      WHEN EXP<=2 THEN 
      SET profile_1 = 'JUNIOR DATA SCIENTIST';
      WHEN EXP >2  AND EXP<=5 THEN 
      SET profile_1 ='ASSOCIATE DATA SCIENTIST';
      WHEN EXP > 5 AND EXP<=10 THEN 
      SET profile_1 ='SENIOR DATA SCIENTIST';
      WHEN EXP > 10 AND EXP<=12 THEN 
      SET profile_1 ='LEAD DATA SCIENTIST';
      WHEN EXP> 12 AND EXP<= 16 THEN
      SET profile_1 ='MANAGER';
	ELSE 
    SET profile_1 ='INVALID';
    END CASE;
    
    RETURN PROFILE_1;
END$$
DELIMITER ;

CASE 
	WHEN ROLE=EXP_JOB_PROFILE(EXP) THEN "VALID"
    ELSE "INVALID"
    END AS PROJECT_STATUS
    FROM DATA_SCIENCE_TEAM;
15.	Create an index to improve the cost and performance of the query to find the employee whose FIRST_NAME is ‘Eric’ in the employee table after checking the execution plan.

 alter table emp_record_table drop index employee_with_first_name;
  CREATE INDEX employee_with_first_name ON
 emp_record_table(first_name);
  EXPLAIN SELECT * FROM emp_record_table WHERE first_name = 'Eric';
  SELECT * FROM emp_record_table WHERE first_name = 'Eric';

16.	Write a query to calculate the bonus for all the employees, based on their ratings and salaries (Use the formula: 5% of salary * employee rating).

select emp_id,first_name,last_name,salary,emp_rating,
    salary*.05*emp_rating as bonus from emp_record_table ;
    

17.	Write a query to calculate the average salary distribution based on the continent and country. Take data from the employee record table.
